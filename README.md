# NLPstats

**Python Web Scraping**

**Overview**

This Python project is designed to scrape web pages from a health-related website and analyze the content using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The script extracts content from each web page, calculates various NLP statistics, and then writes these results to a CSV file. Additionally, it computes and records the average of these statistics across all pages in a separate CSV file.

**Features**

Web Scraping: Extracts text content from multiple web pages on a specified health-related website.
NLP Analysis: Calculates the number of sentences, words, nouns, verbs, and adjectives in the scraped text.
Data Aggregation: Computes the average values of the NLP statistics across all pages.
Result Exportation: Stores individual and aggregated statistics in CSV format for easy analysis and reporting.

**Technologies Used**

Python: The core programming language used for the project.
Selenium: A tool for automating web browsers, used here for scraping web content.
spaCy: An open-source software library for advanced NLP in Python.
CSV Module: For writing the extracted data and NLP statistics into CSV files.

**Requirements**
To run this script, you will need:

Python 3.x
Selenium (selenium package)
spaCy (spacy package) and its English model (en_core_web_sm)
